# pg 205 - first choral ode
- Human can't play god
- "plow" - man is able to manipulate environment
	- nature has created man, but man is able to master nature
- strophe 2 - death conquers man
	- AS 2 - "unsavory ambition" - too much ambition
	- man is good when he is law abiding and religious
	- man is not all-powerful

# second episode
- "mother's son" - honored for family
- death - strophe 2
- "death he never cures" - feels that it could be bad but Antigone may contradict this by saying "death is not necessarily worse than life"
- dividing factor between gods and humans - mortality
	- humans can never achieve what gods can doA
	- "judge" - gods
	- if creon is the one trying to judge Antigone, creon is overstepping his power
	- death can be good bc it is an equalizer
- creon - whoever has power is man over woman
- gods > man > women
	- gods > antigone > man
- value relativism
- humans cannot control death but death cannot control human emotions
	- triangle between judgement, death, and emotion
