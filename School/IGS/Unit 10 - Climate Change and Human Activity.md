# 10a - Sources of Alternative Energy
- **Traditional Electricity**
	- Burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, nat. gas)
		- $\approx$ 63% of electricity in the US (non-renewable)
	- Chemical energy is stored in the bonds of **hydrocarbons**
		- When combusted w/ $O_2$, produces alot of heat/water/$CO_2$
- Non-renewable vs. renewable
	- Non-renewable
		- Fossil fuels = dead plants and animals that have been buried/heated/pressurized
		- Solid = Coal
		- Liquid = Crude oil/petroleum
		- Gas = Natural Gas
		- **Solar energy** is stored in fossil fuels
		- **Nuclear energy** = NON-renewable
	- **Alternative Energy** = Sources energy other than fossil fuels
		- Geothermal
		- Solar
			- Passive
			- Active
		- Hydrogen
		- Hydroelectric
		- Tidal
		- Wind
		- Biomass
		- Nuclear
			- Fission
			- Fusion
	- Sun powers most of the energy sources
- **Why should we care?**
	- Nonhuman consequences of using fossil fuels include mass extinction, loss of habitat, flooding, etc
	- 50% of coral reefs have been lost in the last 30 years and it is expected that we will lose **90%** in the next century
	- Fossil fuels will **run out**
- **Geothermal energy**
	- Natural heat from Earth's crust to heat buildings and generate electricity
	- Common in **volcanically active areas**
	- Tapping naturally into "hydrothermal convection" systems in the **Earth's crust**
		- Cooler water seeps into the crust, heated, rises to surface as steam
		- Steam is captured and use to drive turbines for electricity generation
	- Very limited range b/c you need strong volcanic activitty nearby (Iceland)

# 10.3a - Energy Balance and the Greenhouse Effect
- **Climate** = long-term average of the world's temperature, pressure, precipitation, and other weather events
	- **Temperature** is one of the most important because temperature determines the rate of evaporation, controls how clouds form and a difference in temperature creates winds
	- Driven by the energy of the sun but involves interaction with the atmosphere, oceans, biomass, rocks, and ice
- **Sun** = heat source
	- Earth will warm/cool until the heat given off to space matches the amount of sunlight absorbed by the planet ("energy balance")
	- **Law of Conservation of energy**
- Amount of input energy depends on...
	1. How far Earth's axis tilts
	2. Which direction the Earth tilts
	3. Eccentricity of Earth's orbit
- Amount of heat the earth will release depends on...
	1. How much heat the atmosphere can absorb
		- Sunlight is absorbed by $O_2$ and $O_3$ molecules
		- $O_2$ content has been **constant**
		- The ozone layer has been **depleted** in the  **stratosphere** but the amount of ozone in the **troposphere** has **increased (smog)**
			- Cancels out, nothing has really changed
	2. **Albedo**
		- Darker color = more energy absorbed
		- Earth's albedo is **30%**
			- **30%** of incoming light is **reflected** back into space
			- **70%** of incoming light is **absorbed**
1. **Greenhouse Gases**
	- Gases that **trap** rather than re-radiate heat
		- Warm day inside car
		- Once light enters the Earth's atmosphere, they cannot be re-radiated into space. **Instead**, they warm the planet
		- Act like glass panes in a greenhouse
			- The panes allow visible light to pass through but **trap in the thermal radiation** (**longer wavelength**, **smaller frequency**, and therefore less energy than visible light!)
	- $CO_2, CH_4, H_2O$
		- Absorb long-wavelength radiation (infared)
	- 3 Steps:
		- Atmosphere allows 50% of Sun's energy to reach surface
		- 30% is reflected back into space
		- 20% is absorbed by G.G.
	- Satellite monitoring has shown that thermal radiation **leaving** the Earth has **decreased** while the amount of G.G in the atmosphere has **increased**
2. **Atmospheric Circulation and Global Climate**
	- Factors that drive circulation of the atmosphere
		- Earth is heated unevenly
			- More energy falls on equator than on poles
			- Distribution generates winds that carry heat from equator to poles, then from the surface to the upper atmosphere
		- Coriolis effect
			- How fluids (air/water) move on rotating sphere
3. **Role of oceans in global climate**
	- Oceans can store alot of heat energy
	- 1000x the amount of hear-per-gram as the atmosphere
	- Water = universal solvent
		- Dissolve $CO_2$
	- Ocean holds more carbon than all other sources on Earth
	- "Conveyor Belt" of $CO_2$


# 10.3b - The Role of the Ocean in Our Global Climate
1. Oceans as a heat sink
	- All oceans basins have been warming since 20th century
	- Oceans have been warming 10x more than atmosphere
	- Where is the heat gained and how is it distributed?
2. The Ocean Conveyor Belt
	- 1800, Count Rumford
		- Examined ocean temperature data, confused at the lower temperatures found deep in tropical water
		- He theorized that there was a system of currents running through the oceans
	- Convection
		- **NOTE: Diffusion is NOT possible b/c too slow**
