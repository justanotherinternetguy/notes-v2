		- Total mass of product is somewhat less than U-235
	- **Process of splitting a heavier nucleus into lighter nuclei**
	- Controlled chain reaction
	- When a neutron collides with a nucleus, the nucleus splits in two **isotopes**, each of which is roughly half the mass of the original atom
	- A small amount of mass is "left over" and becomes **energy**
		- $E = mc^2$
	- Atomic bombs carry out the fission of a heavy element **uncontrolled**

# 10.3a - Energy Balance and the Greenhouse Effect
- **Climate** = long-term average of the world's temperature, pressure, precipitation, and other weather events
	- **Temperature** is one of the most important because temperature determines the rate of evaporation, controls how clouds form and a difference in temperature creates winds
	- Driven by the energy of the sun but involves interaction with the atmosphere, oceans, biomass, rocks, and ice
- **Sun** = heat source
	- Earth will warm/cool until the heat given off to space matches the amount of sunlight absorbed by the planet ("energy balance")
	- **Law of Conservation of Energy**
- Amount of input energy depends on...
	1. How far Earth's axis tilts
	2. Which direction the Earth tilts
	3. Eccentricity of Earth's orbit
- Amount of heat the earth will release depends on...
	1. How much heat the atmosphere can absorb
		- Sunlight is absorbed by $O_2$ and $O_3$ molecules
		- $O_2$ content has been **constant**
		- The ozone layer has been **depleted** in the  **stratosphere** but the amount of ozone in the **troposphere** has **increased (smog)**
			- Cancels out, nothing has really changed
	2. **Albedo**
		- Darker color = more energy absorbed
		- Earth's albedo is **30%**
			- **30%** of incoming light is **reflected** back into space
			- **70%** of incoming light is **absorbed**
1. **Greenhouse Gases**
	- Gases that **trap** rather than re-radiate heat
		- Warm day inside car
		- Once light enters the Earth's atmosphere, they cannot be re-radiated into space. **Instead**, they warm the planet
		- Act like glass panes in a greenhouse
			- The panes allow visible light to pass through but **trap in the thermal radiation** (**longer wavelength**, **smaller frequency**, and therefore less energy than visible light!)
	- $CO_2, CH_4, H_2O$
		- Absorb long-wavelength radiation (infared)
	- 3 Steps:
		- Atmosphere allows 50% of Sun's energy to reach surface
		- 30% is reflected back into space
		- 20% is absorbed by G.G.
	- Satellite monitoring has shown that thermal radiation **leaving** the Earth has **decreased** while the amount of G.G in the atmosphere has **increased**
2. **Atmospheric Circulation and Global Climate**
	- Factors that drive circulation of the atmosphere
		- Earth is heated unevenly
			- More energy falls on equator than on poles
			- Distribution generates winds that carry heat from equator to poles, then from the surface to the upper atmosphere
		- Coriolis effect
			- How fluids (air/water) move on rotating sphere
3. **Role of oceans in global climate**
	- Oceans can store alot of heat energy
	- 1000x the amount of heat-per-gram as the atmosphere
	- Water = universal solvent
		- Dissolve $CO_2$
	- Ocean holds more carbon than all other sources on Earth
	- "Conveyor Belt" of $CO_2$


# 10.3b - The Role of the Ocean in Our Global Climate
1. Oceans as a heat sink
	- All oceans basins have been warming since 20th century
	- Oceans have been warming 10x more than atmosphere
	- Where is the heat gained and how is it distributed?
2. The Ocean Conveyor Belt
	- 1800, Count Rumford
		- Examined ocean temperature data, confused at the lower temperatures found deep in tropical water
		- He theorized that there was a system of currents running through the oceans
	- **Convection**
		- **NOTE: Diffusion is NOT possible b/c too slow** 
		- As water sinks, the water carries all the properties they had on the surface, **including heat**. 
		- Surface currents are **faster**
			- Surface Gulf Stream = 100km/day
			- Deep interior currents = 0.1-1km/day
		- Radioactive tracers = Atomic bomb blown up underwater, radioactive waste can be traced around the ocean
			- We **do not know** if heat moves in the same way as radioactive tracers
	- **Salinity**
		- Climate change --> Ice melts --> More freshwater to ocean --> Salinity decreases --> Density of surface water decreases
		- If surface water decreases, it may not sink as far down
		- If the ocean conveyor belt no longer reaches the deep ocean basins, then the **reservoir** **available** for **heat storage** would be **reduced**
# 10.4 - Pre-20th Century Drivers of Climate Change
- **Drivers** = Factors that affect climate but aren't themselves affected buy climate
- **LONG-TERM (10,000,000 years+)**
	- Stellar evolution
		- Sun's luminosity
	- Plate tectonics
		- Ocean currents have to change b/c landmasses move
	- Evolution of life
		- Contributions of the biosphere to long-term climate change, impact of **p-syn** organisms
- **MIDDLE-TERM (1000 years)**
	- Eccentricity of Earth's orbit
		- Currently Earth is closest to the Sun in January
		- 6,000 years ago, the closest approach was in September, so summers in the Northern Hemisphere were warmer than today
	- Obliquity
		- When tilt is less, the seasons are milder
	- These effects combine to produce ice-age cycles
- **SHORT-TERM (days-years)**
	- Varying luminosity of Sun
		- 11-year solar cycle where Sun gets brighter/dimmer over time
	- Volcanic activity
		- Volcanoes produces small amounts of $CO_2$
		- Big eruptions give off large amounts of $SO_2$
			- Aerosol
			- Has effect of cooling the planet by reflecting radiation back into space
			- Has the greatest cooling effect in the stratosphere
	- Large asteroid impacts
- Human influences
	- Climate change
	- Increase in average global temperature
	- Decrease of snow content in North Hemisphere
	- Rising sea levels
	- Melting of glaciers
- **Radiative Forcing**
	- Difference between what flows into the earth and what flows out
	- **Positive** = **Warming**
		- Air pollution
	- **Negative** = **Cooling**
		- Volcanic eruption
	- **Anthropogenic** = Any process, activity, or effect that is caused or influenced by human beings
- $CO_2, CH_4, N_2O$ (greenhouse gases) are produced by
	- Emissions from burning fossil fuels
	- Deforestation
	- Fossil fuel extraction and transport (coal mining, natural gas flaring, pipeline leakage) 
	- Rice cultivation
	- Livestock rearing 
	- Landfills and manure ponds
	- Production of fertilizers
- Real damage of increase greenhouse gases are offset by negative forcings from:
	- Incomplete combustion
	- Fires
	- Power plants
	- Desert Dust
	- Sea Salt
	- Sulfates
	- Nitrates
	- Carbon containing particles
		- *Note: Black/sooty carbon exert a positive forcing effect b/c it absorbs heat*

# 10.5 - Climate Feedback and Processes
- **Feedback** = Response to a change that influences the change itself
- **Water vapor** = Warmer air --> holds more water vapor (7% more water per degree Celsius) --> b/c water vapor **is a greenhouse gas** --> air warms up more...
	- Increased evaporation (from increase heat) also causes more **condensation** and more **frequent/severe precipitation**
	- Can occur over a matter of days to thousands of years
	- Warm climate --> snow/ice melts --> reducing albedo --> more warming
	- By **2050**, there will be no more sea ice left in the Arctic in the late summer
- **Venus** is a good example
	- Solar radiation caused rocks to grow hotter and release more $CO_2$ into Venusian atmosphere, causing the atmosphere to grow ever hotter and cause more $CO_2$ to be released
- **Carbon cycle feedback** = $CO_2$ response to forcing
	- P-sync increases in warmer climate, leads to **higher consumption** of $CO_2$
	- Higher temperatures --> droughts --> less plants --> **less consumption** of $CO_2$
- **Keeling Curve** = Concentration of $CO_2$ in Earth's atmosphere since 1958
	- ![](Pasted%20image%2020230507144855.png)
	- Steady increase in $CO_2$
	- Reflects **seasonal variations**
		- Plants absorb the most $CO_2$ at the **end of summer** and least at the **start of winter**
- **Methane ($CH_4$)**
	- Largest source of emissions is wetlands
		- Emissions increase with temperature
	- $CH_4$ due to human activity accounts for 20% of global warming effect since the Industrial Revolution
	- Water, wetter climate --> More $CH_4$
	- $CH_4$ changes are driven by an increased emission from agricultural, waste management, and fossil fuels
	- Permafrost and undersea deposits contain an enormous amount of $CH_4$ and are released as climate warms
- **The Carbon Cycle and How it Influences Climate**
	- 99.9% of carbon is trapped in **rocks**
	- **Fossil fuel consumption and cement production** has transferred so much carbon that belongs below the Earth to the Earth's surface itself
	- ![](Pasted%20image%2020230507145711.png)
	- Transfer from fossil fuels (below surface) to the surface is **irreversible**
	- Oceans will absorb $CO_2$. What are the problems?
		1. Ocean can only absorb 50% of what is currently being emitted
		2. $CO_2 + H_2O + H_2CO_3$ (carbonic acid)
			- Makes oceans acidic and harmful to marine ecosystems and coral
		3. Ocean warms and absorb less $CO_2$
			1. Positive forcing (warming)
