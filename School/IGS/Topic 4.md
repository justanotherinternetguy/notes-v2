# Topic 4: Coal
- Coal is perhaps the dirtiest of all fossil fuels, but it accounted for 11.3% of US energy consumption in 2019. “Clean” coal generally refers to carbon capture and storage (CCS), not the actual coal itself, but CCS can also refer to wet scrubbers that remove sulfur dioxide, coal washing that removes soil and rock, or even the digitization of coal plants.


- What is “clean” coal? What is normal/traditional coal? How are they similar? Different?
- Is one type of coal safer (or more dangerous) than the other?
- How do carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies work? What are the pros and cons of CCS technologies?
- Are there any links between CCS and net zero carbon and/or the green new deal? If so, what? If not, why?


## What is “clean” coal? What is normal/traditional coal? How are they similar? Different?

#### CHATGPT
-   "Clean" coal refers to technologies and processes aimed at reducing the environmental impact of coal-fired power plants. These technologies include advanced combustion techniques, carbon capture and storage (CCS), and other emissions reduction measures.
-   Traditional or normal coal, on the other hand, refers to the conventional coal used in power generation without any advanced technologies to reduce its environmental impact.
-   The primary similarity between clean and traditional coal is that they are both derived from the same natural resource - coal. Both types of coal also produce energy when burned, making them important sources of electricity generation worldwide.
-   However, the key difference between clean and traditional coal is their environmental impact. While traditional coal releases a significant amount of pollutants, including greenhouse gases, into the atmosphere, clean coal technologies aim to reduce these emissions significantly. This means that clean coal is considered a more environmentally friendly alternative to traditional coal.
-   Overall, the term "clean" coal is a bit of a misnomer, as there is no such thing as completely clean coal. However, the development and use of clean coal technologies represent a significant step towards reducing the environmental impact of coal-fired power generation.

#### BING
-   "Clean coal" usually refers to the process of capturing carbon emissions from burning coal and storing them in underground pockets of porous rock. This process is known as carbon capture and storage (CCS)¹. Traditional coal, on the other hand, is burned without capturing the carbon emissions.
-   The main difference between clean coal and traditional coal is that clean coal technology aims to reduce the environmental impact of burning coal by capturing and storing carbon emissions¹. However, it is important to note that CCS technology is expensive to build new infrastructure and retrofit old plants¹.

Coal is a fossil fuel that has been used for centuries to generate electricity and heat. Traditional coal is mined from the ground and burned to produce energy. However, burning coal produces carbon dioxide and other pollutants that contribute to climate change and air pollution[1](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/column-clean-coal-mean-can-save-planet)[2](https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/infrastructure/news/a27886/how-does-clean-coal-work/). Clean coal, on the other hand, refers to technologies that capture carbon emissions from burning coal and store them in underground pockets of porous rock[2](https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/infrastructure/news/a27886/how-does-clean-coal-work/)[4](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/energy-and-the-environment/clean-coal-technologies.aspx). The term "clean coal" is vague and can refer to a range of technologies, including wet scrubbers that remove sulfur dioxide from coal-generated gas and coal washing that removes soil and rock from coal before it is sent to a factory[2](https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/infrastructure/news/a27886/how-does-clean-coal-work/). Clean coal technologies are designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels[4](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/energy-and-the-environment/clean-coal-technologies.aspx). Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is one such technology that captures carbon dioxide emitted from smokestacks and buries it underground[3](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/23/climate/what-clean-coal-is-and-isnt.html). However, CCS is expensive to build new infrastructure and retrofit old plants[2](https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/infrastructure/news/a27886/how-does-clean-coal-work/). There is also typically at least a 20% energy penalty involved in clean coal processes[4](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/energy-and-the-environment/clean-coal-technologies.aspx). Critics argue that "clean coal" is a misleading term for any of these techniques[3](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/23/climate/what-clean-coal-is-and-isnt.html). While clean coal technologies have advanced the thermal efficiency of burning coal to make electricity, they still produce more air pollution than alternatives like renewables[5](https://odi.org/en/insights/how-clean-is-clean-coal/). Advanced coal can produce 40% less CO2 than conventional plants, but it is more expensive than cleaner competitors like onshore wind, geothermal, or natural gas[5](https://odi.org/en/insights/how-clean-is-clean-coal/). In summary, traditional coal is mined from the ground and burned to produce energy, while clean coal refers to technologies that capture carbon emissions from burning coal and store them in underground pockets of porous rock. Clean coal technologies are designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels, but they are expensive and still produce more air pollution than alternatives like renewables.

#### Is one type of coal safer (or more dangerous) than the other?

#### CHATGPT
-   The term "clean coal" refers to coal that has been processed to reduce emissions of pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. This is typically achieved through the use of technologies such as scrubbers and selective catalytic reduction.
-   While the use of these technologies can make burning coal cleaner than traditional coal, it's important to note that "clean coal" is not necessarily completely safe. Burning coal still produces carbon dioxide, which is a major contributor to climate change, and can also produce other harmful pollutants such as mercury and arsenic.
-   Furthermore, the production and transportation of coal can also pose safety risks to workers and nearby communities. Mining accidents, for example, can lead to injuries and fatalities, and coal transportation can result in accidents and spills that can harm the environment and human health.
-   Overall, while "clean coal" may be safer than traditional coal in terms of reducing certain pollutants, it is still not a completely safe energy source and has significant environmental and safety concerns.
    
#### BING
-   "Clean coal" usually refers to technologies that aim to reduce the environmental impact of burning coal. One such technology is **carbon capture and storage (CCS)**, which captures carbon emissions from burning coal and stores them underground ¹. While CCS does work, it is expensive to build new infrastructure and retrofit old plants ¹.
-   There are other dangers associated with burning coal too. For example, when we burn coal, we undo its long-term sequestration, producing soot and volatile gases that pollute our atmosphere alongside the energy ². However, coal-fired electricity generation is cleaner than ever. A new coal plant with pollution controls reduces nitrogen oxides by 83 percent, sulfur dioxide by 98 percent, and particulate matter by 99.8 percent compared to plants without controls ⁴.

#### PERPLEX
The term "clean coal" refers to a series of systems and technologies that seek to mitigate the health and environmental impact of coal energy generation and to mitigate worldwide climate change[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_pollution_mitigation). Clean coal technology is a collection of technologies being developed in attempts to lessen the negative environmental impact of coal energy generation[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_pollution_mitigation). The technologies range from wet scrubbers, which remove sulfur dioxide from coal-generated gas, to coal washing, which removes soil and rock from coal before it’s sent to a factory[1](https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/infrastructure/news/a27886/how-does-clean-coal-work/). The term could be applied to anything that makes coal plants more efficient, like digitization[1](https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/infrastructure/news/a27886/how-does-clean-coal-work/). Coal-fired electricity generation is cleaner than ever, and a new coal plant with pollution controls reduces nitrogen oxides by 83 percent, sulfur dioxide by 98 percent, and particulate matter by 99.8 percent compared to plants without controls[3](https://www.energy.gov/articles/clean-coal-crucial-american-jobs-energy-security-and-national-supply-chains). However, coal- and/or oil-fired electric utilities emit many hazardous air pollutants listed in the Clean Air Act[4](https://www.epa.gov/mats/cleaner-power-plants). Emissions standards set by the EPA have reduced toxic pollutants, even though pollution control technology is widely available[4](https://www.epa.gov/mats/cleaner-power-plants). The EPA's Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) set standards for all Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs) emitted by coal- and oil-fired EGUs with a capacity of 25 megawatts or greater[4](https://www.epa.gov/mats/cleaner-power-plants). In summary, "clean" coal technology aims to mitigate the negative environmental impact of coal energy generation. While coal-fired electricity generation is cleaner than ever, coal- and/or oil-fired electric utilities still emit many hazardous air pollutants listed in the Clean Air Act. The EPA has set emissions standards to reduce toxic pollutants, but pollution control technology is widely available.

## How do carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies work? What are the pros and cons of CCS technologies?

#### CHATGPT
-   Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies are designed to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from industrial processes or power plants, transport them to a storage location, and securely store them underground or in other suitable locations. The general process for CCS involves three steps:
-   1. Carbon capture: This is the process of capturing CO2 emissions from industrial processes or power plants. This can be done in several ways, including pre-combustion capture, post-combustion capture, and oxy-fuel combustion.
-   2. Carbon transport: Once the CO2 has been captured, it must be transported to a storage location. This can be done through pipelines or other forms of transport.
-   3. Carbon storage: Once the CO2 has been transported to a storage location, it is stored underground or in other suitable locations. The most common storage method is underground storage in depleted oil and gas reservoirs, saline aquifers, or unminable coal seams.
    
-   Pros of CCS technologies:
-   - CCS can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change.
-   - CCS can be used with existing fossil fuel infrastructure, making it a useful tool for reducing emissions from industries that are difficult to decarbonize, such as cement production, steel production, and aviation.
-   - CCS can help reduce the cost of transitioning to a low-carbon economy by allowing industries to continue to use fossil fuels while reducing their emissions.
-   Cons of CCS technologies:
-   - CCS is expensive and can increase the cost of energy production.
-   - The long-term safety of CO2 storage is uncertain and requires careful monitoring to prevent leakage.
-   - CCS does not address the root causes of climate change, such as the burning of fossil fuels, and may encourage the continued use of fossil fuels.
-   - CCS requires large amounts of water, which could create additional environmental problems.

#### BING
-   Carbon capture and storage (CCS) refers to a collection of technologies that can combat climate change by reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The idea behind CCS is to capture the CO2 generated by burning fossil fuels before it is released into the atmosphere ¹.
-   Most current CCS strategies call for the injection of CO2 deep underground. This forms a “closed loop”, where the carbon is extracted from the Earth as fossil fuels and then is returned to the Earth as CO2 ¹.
-   There are pros and cons to using CCS technologies. One advantage is that it can help reduce CO2 emissions from large stationary sources like power plants or industrial plants that make cement, steel, and chemicals ¹. However, many CCUS projects are economically challenged today, with high costs of capture for dilute point sources and a limited number of revenue streams available ².

The Clean Air Act is a comprehensive federal law that regulates air emissions from stationary and mobile sources in the United States[1](https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/clean-air-act)[3](https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-clean-air-act). The law was established in 1970 and has been amended several times since then[1](https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/clean-air-act)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Air_Act_(United_States)). The Clean Air Act aims to protect human health and the environment from the harmful effects of air pollution by regulating emissions of pollutants that "endanger public health and welfare"[1](https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/clean-air-act). The law authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to protect public health and welfare and to regulate emissions of hazardous air pollutants[3](https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-clean-air-act). The Clean Air Act has helped reduce ground-level ozone, mercury emissions, acid rain, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and lead air pollution[1](https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/clean-air-act). The law has also spurred innovation and created jobs by requiring industries to develop and adopt cutting-edge solutions to reduce pollution from power plants, factories, and cars[1](https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/clean-air-act). The Clean Air Act is an important tool for protecting public health and the environment from the harmful effects of air pollution in the United States.

## Are there any links between CCS and net zero carbon and/or the green new deal? If so, what? If not, why?

#### CHATGPT
-   Yes, there are links between CCS (carbon capture and storage) and net zero carbon, as well as the Green New Deal.
-   CCS technology plays a crucial role in achieving net-zero emissions, which is necessary to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, as recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). CCS technologies are designed to capture carbon dioxide emissions from industrial processes or power generation, transport them via pipelines or ships, and store them safely underground in geological formations, such as depleted oil and gas reservoirs, saline formations, or unmineable coal seams.
-   CCS can also be used to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, a process known as Direct Air Capture (DAC), which has the potential to offset hard-to-abate emissions from sectors such as aviation and shipping.
-   The Green New Deal is a policy proposal aimed at transitioning the United States to a low-carbon economy, with a focus on creating green jobs, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and promoting social justice. CCS is among the technologies that are highlighted in the Green New Deal as a tool for decarbonizing the economy.
-   In summary, CCS is a critical technology for achieving net zero emissions and is relevant to the goals of the Green New Deal.

#### BING
-   Yes, there are links between CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) and net zero carbon. CCS is one of the technological solutions to deliver negative emissions with bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) and direct air capture with CCS (DACCS)¹. It is a method of mitigating carbon emissions by removing and trapping carbon that has already been released into the atmosphere². This technology is considered important in achieving net zero emissions by 2050³.
-   As for the Green New Deal, it is an ambitious plan to fight climate change through clean energy. President Joe Biden endorsed it as part of his 2020 presidential platform and pledged to "ensure the U.S. achieves a 100% clean energy economy and reaches net-zero emissions no later than 2050"². So, it seems that CCS could play a role in achieving the goals of the Green New Deal.

Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) is a technology that can help reduce emissions in industrial sectors[1](https://www.iea.org/fuels-and-technologies/carbon-capture-utilisation-and-storage). CCUS is expected to play a crucial role in meeting global climate targets, and it is "unavoidable" if net-zero emissions are to be achieved[3](https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/explainers/what-is-carbon-capture-and-storage-and-what-role-can-it-play-in-tackling-climate-change/). The latest IPCC assessment report warns that the deployment of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies is "unavoidable" if net-zero emissions are to be achieved[3](https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/explainers/what-is-carbon-capture-and-storage-and-what-role-can-it-play-in-tackling-climate-change/). CCUS can allow the continued operation of energy-intensive industries in a net-zero-compliant way, preventing the many jobs and assets that they support from becoming stranded[3](https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/explainers/what-is-carbon-capture-and-storage-and-what-role-can-it-play-in-tackling-climate-change/). Although serious analyses and pathways to achieve net-zero commitments by 2050 require CCUS as a solution, many still see CCUS as enabling the continuation of the fossil-fuel industry and do not perceive it as a "clean" technology in the way that they see renewable energy[2](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/oil-and-gas/our-insights/scaling-the-ccus-industry-to-achieve-net-zero-emissions). However, CCUS can bring important climate benefits, but with caveats. CO2 use does not necessarily lead to emissions reduction. Climate benefits associated with a given CO2 use depend on the source of the CO2 (natural, fossil, biogenic, or air-captured), the product or service the CO2-based product is displacing, the carbon intensity of the energy used for the conversion[1](https://www.iea.org/fuels-and-technologies/carbon-capture-utilisation-and-storage). The Green New Deal (GND) proposed in the US Congress in 2019 discusses only an extremely limited number of approaches to remove carbon dioxide[4](https://energycentral.com/c/ec/green-new-deal-and-carbon-dioxide-removal-approaches). The drafters of the Green New Deal's vision are too narrow, and the bill should be amended to provide for a national research and development program[4](https://energycentral.com/c/ec/green-new-deal-and-carbon-dioxide-removal-approaches). If any future incarnation of the Green New Deal is truly to be a "deal" from the perspective of effectively addressing climate change, it should embrace a robust research agenda for an array of carbon dioxide removal approaches[4](https://energycentral.com/c/ec/green-new-deal-and-carbon-dioxide-removal-approaches). While there is a compelling case for carbon dioxide removal as part of any national plan to address climate change, the GND's vision is too narrow[4](https://energycentral.com/c/ec/green-new-deal-and-carbon-dioxide-removal-approaches).
