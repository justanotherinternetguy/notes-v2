# Topic 4: Coal
- Coal is perhaps the dirtiest of all fossil fuels, but it accounted for 11.3% of US energy consumption in 2019. “Clean” coal generally refers to carbon capture and storage (CCS), not the actual coal itself, but CCS can also refer to wet scrubbers that remove sulfur dioxide, coal washing that removes soil and rock, or even the digitization of coal plants.


- What is “clean” coal? What is normal/traditional coal? How are they similar? Different?
- Is one type of coal safer (or more dangerous) than the other?
- How do carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies work? What are the pros and cons of CCS technologies?
- Are there any links between CCS and net zero carbon and/or the green new deal? If so, what? If not, why?
