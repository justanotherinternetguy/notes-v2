# 10.3 - Energy Balance and the Greenhouse Effect
- **Climate** = long-term average of the world's temperature, pressure, precipitation, and other weather events
	- **Temperature** is one of the most important because temperature determines the rate of evaporation, controls how clouds form and a difference in temperature creates winds
	- Driven by the energy of the sun but involves interaction with the atmosphere, oceans, biomass, rocks, and ice
- **Sun** = heat source
	- Earth will warm/cool until the heat given off to space matches the amount of sunlight absorbed by the planet ("energy balance")
	- **Law of Conservation of energy**
- Amount of input energy depends on...
	1. How far Earth's axis tilts
	2. Which direction the Earth tilts
	3. Eccentricity of Earth's orbit
- Amount of heat the earth will release depends on...
	1. How much heat the atmosphere can absorb
	2. **Albedo**
