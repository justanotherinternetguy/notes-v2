- The Green New Deal (GND) is a proposed set of policy initiatives in the United States that aim to address climate change, reduce economic inequality, and promote economic growth ¹. It proposes a transition to 100% clean, renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and geothermal power within 10 years ¹. The plan also calls for a major investment in infrastructure, including the development of a modern energy grid, the upgrading of buildings to be more energy-efficient, and the expansion of public transportation ¹.
- The Green New Deal is not just about the environment and climate change. It also seeks to address societal problems like economic inequality and racial injustice ³. It's a framework for mobilizing the federal government to create millions of family-sustaining, union jobs and fight the climate crisis at the same time ³.

## What would have to be done?

#### CHATGPT
To make the Green New Deal happen, the following would need to be done:

1. Adoption of a comprehensive plan to combat climate change, including transitioning to renewable energy sources, investing in green infrastructure, and implementing policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
2. Investment in job training and creation of new, sustainable jobs in the renewable energy and green sectors.
3. Commitment to reducing income inequality and ensuring that the transition to a green economy benefits all communities, including historically marginalized ones.
4. Adoption of policies to reduce carbon emissions and encourage sustainable practices, such as a carbon tax, cap-and-trade system, and regulations on industries that contribute heavily to climate change.
5. Investment in research and development of new technologies to accelerate the transition to a green economy.

Obstacles that could prevent the implementation of the Green New Deal include:

1. Resistance from industries and individuals who benefit from the current fossil fuel-based economy.
2. Political polarization and lack of bipartisan support for comprehensive climate action.
3. Economic challenges related to the cost of transitioning to a green economy, including investment in new infrastructure and job training.
4. Lack of public awareness and support for the urgency of addressing climate change.
5. International competition and coordination on climate policies, including trade policies that could incentivize carbon-intensive production in countries with weaker environmental regulations.

The Green New Deal is a congressional resolution that calls for a “10-year national mobilization” to make the United States carbon-neutral across the economy³. Some experts believe that there are no technical or economic weaknesses to the Green New Deal, but social and political opposition is formidable¹. The fossil fuel industry has a lot at stake and they oppose all legislation that will phase them out¹.

#### PERPLEXITY
To make the Green New Deal happen, the following would need to be done:

- Congress would need to pass legislation to turn the Green New Deal resolution into a reality [2]
- The federal government would need to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, create high-paying jobs, ensure that clean air, clean water, and healthy food are basic human rights, and end all forms of oppression [1]
- The U.S. economy would need to be transformed away from fossil fuels and towards clean energy [2]
- The U.S. would need to cut net greenhouse gas emissions to zero over ten years, spur massive growth in clean manufacturing, and meet power use with 100% clean energy [4]
- The U.S. would need to invest in infrastructure, expand access to clean air and drinking water, spur American technological innovations, and create good-paying, union jobs [3]

Obstacles that could prevent the Green New Deal from happening include:
- The cost of implementing the Green New Deal, which has been estimated to be in the trillions of dollars [2]
- The potential for the Green New Deal to slow down the economy and require a lot of overhaul and government oversight [2]
