# Topic 3: Nuclear Fission Energy
- Debates about nuclear energy range from whether it should be included in green or clean plans as a non-renewable energy, whether nuclear power should be phased out of use, whether the US federal government should subsidize nuclear energy, and whether the expansion of nuclear energy contributes to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. According to the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), “Nuclear energy comes from splitting atoms in a reactor to heat water into steam, turn a turbine and generate electricity. Ninety-four nuclear reactors in 28 states generate nearly 20 percent of the nation’s electricity, all without carbon emissions because reactors use uranium, not fossil fuels. These plants are always on: well-operated to avoid interruptions and built to withstand extreme weather, supporting the grid 24/7.”

- What is nuclear energy? What is required for nuclear energy to occur? (HINT: All nuclear power plants perform nuclear fission, NOT nuclear fusion).
- What are the consequences of nuclear energy? What are the benefits of nuclear energy?
- Are there any links between nuclear energy and the green new deal and/or net zero carbon? Why/why not?

## What is nuclear energy?
- Splitting the nucleus of an atom, releasing energy and heat
- Neutron is fired at U-235 or Pu-239
- Every time a nucleus splits, it will release more neutrons, causing a chain reaction that produces a lot of energy
- Requires a sufficient amount of energy to begin the chain reaction

## Positives
- Low GG emissions
- High energy density
- Reliable

## Negatives
- Radioactive waste
- Nuclear Accidents
- Proliferation
- High capital costs

## Links between nuclear fission, GND, and NZC
- More than half of the zero-carbon capacity comes from nuclear energy
- However, GND wants to exclude nuclear energy
- IAEA - report of nuclear fission ahead of COP26 Climate Summit
    - Highlights nuclear power's critical role in achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement
    - Displaces coal + FFs
    - Enables further deployment of renewable energy and becoming an economical source for large, clean amounts of hydrogen
