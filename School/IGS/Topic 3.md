# Topic 3: Nuclear Fission Energy
- Debates about nuclear energy range from whether it should be included in green or clean plans as a non-renewable energy, whether nuclear power should be phased out of use, whether the US federal government should subsidize nuclear energy, and whether the expansion of nuclear energy contributes to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. According to the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), “Nuclear energy comes from splitting atoms in a reactor to heat water into steam, turn a turbine and generate electricity. Ninety-four nuclear reactors in 28 states generate nearly 20 percent of the nation’s electricity, all without carbon emissions because reactors use uranium, not fossil fuels. These plants are always on: well-operated to avoid interruptions and built to withstand extreme weather, supporting the grid 24/7.”

- What is nuclear energy? What is required for nuclear energy to occur? (HINT: All nuclear power plants perform nuclear fission, NOT nuclear fusion).
- What are the consequences of nuclear energy? What are the benefits of nuclear energy?
- Are there any links between nuclear energy and the green new deal and/or net zero carbon? Why/why not?

## What is nuclear energy?

## What is nuclear fission energy? What is required for nuclear fission energy to occur?

#### CHATGPT
-   Nuclear fission energy is a type of energy that is released when the nucleus of an atom is split into two smaller nuclei. This process involves the breaking apart of the nucleus of an atom, which releases a tremendous amount of energy in the form of heat and radiation. Nuclear fission energy is used to generate electricity in nuclear power plants.
-   To initiate nuclear fission, a nucleus of an atom must be struck by a neutron with sufficient energy to break it apart. When this happens, the nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei, along with the release of additional neutrons and a large amount of energy. These released neutrons can then go on to strike other nuclei, causing a chain reaction that releases even more energy.
-   To maintain a chain reaction, a critical mass of nuclear fuel, such as uranium or plutonium, must be present. Additionally, a moderator, such as water or graphite, is often used to slow down the neutrons and increase the likelihood of further fission events. A coolant, such as water or gas, is also used to transfer the heat generated by the fission reactions to a heat exchanger, where it is used to generate steam and produce electricity.

#### BING
-   Nuclear fission is the process of splitting apart nuclei (usually large nuclei) into two fragments of roughly equal mass. When large nuclei, such as uranium-235, fissions, energy is released. So much energy is released that there is a measurable decrease in mass, from the mass-energy equivalence. This means that some of the mass is converted to energy²⁵.
    
-   The process may take place spontaneously in some cases or may be induced by the excitation of the nucleus with a variety of particles (e.g., neutrons, protons, deuterons, or alpha particles) or with electromagnetic radiation in the form of gamma rays².

#### PERPLEX
Nuclear fission is a process where the nucleus of an atom splits into two or more smaller nuclei, releasing a large amount of energy in the form of heat and radiation[1](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/nuclear/)[2](https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/what-is-nuclear-energy-the-science-of-nuclear-power)[3](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Nuclear_fission). During nuclear fission, a neutron collides with a uranium atom and splits it, releasing a large amount of energy in the form of heat and radiation. More neutrons are also released when a uranium atom splits. These neutrons continue to collide with other uranium atoms, and the process repeats itself over and over again. This process is called a nuclear chain reaction[1](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/nuclear/). Nuclear fission requires a relatively unstable large nucleus, such as uranium-235, to split apart[3](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Nuclear_fission). When a neutron collides with a uranium-235 nucleus, it becomes unstable and splits into two smaller nuclei, releasing energy in the process. This energy is used to heat water, which produces steam that drives a turbine to generate electricity[1](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/nuclear/). Uranium and plutonium are most commonly used for fission reactions in nuclear power reactors because they are easy to initiate and control[4](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/fission-and-fusion-what-difference). Nuclear fission is used in nuclear power plants to produce electricity[1](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/nuclear/). Nuclear fusion, where atoms are combined or fused together to form a larger atom, is another way to release nuclear energy. Fusion is the source of energy in the sun and stars. However, technology to generate electricity from fusion is still in the research and development phase[1](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/nuclear/)[2](https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/what-is-nuclear-energy-the-science-of-nuclear-power).

## What are the consequences of nuclear fission energy? What are the benefits of nuclear fission energy?

#### CHATGPT
-   Nuclear fission energy has both consequences and benefits, as outlined below:
-   Consequences of Nuclear Fission Energy:
-   - Radioactive waste: Nuclear fission produces radioactive waste that remains hazardous for thousands of years. Safe disposal of this waste is a major challenge.
-   - Accidents: Nuclear accidents, such as those at Chernobyl and Fukushima, can cause significant health and environmental consequences.
-   - Nuclear proliferation: The technology and materials used in nuclear fission energy can also be used for nuclear weapons, which raises concerns about nuclear proliferation.
-   Benefits of Nuclear Fission Energy:
-   - Low greenhouse gas emissions: Nuclear fission energy emits very little greenhouse gases, making it a low-carbon energy source.
-   - Reliable and consistent energy: Nuclear power plants can operate 24/7, providing a consistent and reliable source of energy.
-   - Energy independence: Countries that rely on imported fossil fuels can reduce their dependence on foreign energy sources by using nuclear power.
-   - Large-scale energy production: Nuclear power plants can produce large amounts of energy, making them useful for meeting the energy needs of large populations.
-   It is important to weigh both the consequences and benefits of nuclear fission energy when considering its use as an energy source.

#### BING
-   Nuclear fission energy has both advantages and disadvantages. Some of the advantages include that it can provide cheap energy resources for the planet¹, it offers a low-emission energy solution¹, it works for extended periods of time¹, and it is a reliable source of energy¹. On the other hand, some of the disadvantages include that it can be dangerous¹, it creates harmful waste products¹, and it has high start-up costs¹.

#### PERPLEX
Nuclear fission energy has both advantages and disadvantages. One of the main benefits of nuclear fission energy is that it produces energy without releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which reduces the effects of global warming and helps fight pollution[1](https://byjus.com/jee/nuclear-fission/)[2](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/advantages-and-challenges-nuclear-energy)[3](https://earth.org/the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-nuclear-energy/)[5](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zjqsd6f/revision/3). Nuclear energy is the largest source of clean power in the United States, generating nearly 800 billion kilowatt hours of electricity each year and producing more than half of the nation’s emissions-free electricity[2](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/advantages-and-challenges-nuclear-energy). Nuclear fission creates a large amount of energy from a very small amount of fuel, which allows us to produce the amount of energy that is required without the need to tap into reserve products or stockpiled items to maintain the current quality of life[4](https://vittana.org/14-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-nuclear-fission). Nuclear power creates employment opportunities for many people[5](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zjqsd6f/revision/3). However, nuclear fission energy also has several disadvantages. One of the main concerns is the risk of radiation exposure[1](https://byjus.com/jee/nuclear-fission/)[3](https://earth.org/the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-nuclear-energy/). Radioactive waste is extremely dangerous and long-lasting, and expensive measures must be taken to store it[4](https://vittana.org/14-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-nuclear-fission)[5](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zjqsd6f/revision/3). Nuclear fuels used for fission, such as uranium ore, are non-renewable energy resources since supplies will not last forever[5](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zjqsd6f/revision/3). Commercial nuclear power is sometimes viewed by the general public as a dangerous or unstable process[2](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/advantages-and-challenges-nuclear-energy). In conclusion, nuclear fission energy has both benefits and drawbacks. While it produces energy without releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and creates employment opportunities, it also poses risks of radiation exposure and produces long-lasting radioactive waste.

## Are there any links between nuclear energy and the green new deal and/or net zero carbon? Why/why not?

#### CHATGPT
-   Yes, there are links between nuclear energy and the Green New Deal (GND) and net-zero carbon goals. Nuclear energy is a low-carbon energy source that can provide a significant contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving a net-zero carbon economy.
-   The Green New Deal is a proposed set of economic stimulus programs in the United States aimed at addressing climate change and economic inequality. It calls for a transition to 100% renewable energy by 2030. While the primary focus of the GND is on renewables, it also acknowledges the role of other low-carbon energy sources, including nuclear energy, in achieving its goals.
-   Similarly, achieving net-zero carbon emissions, which many countries have committed to as part of the Paris Agreement, will require a significant increase in low-carbon energy sources. Nuclear energy can play a role in achieving this goal by providing reliable, low-carbon baseload power, particularly in areas where renewables are not yet able to provide consistent power.
-   However, nuclear energy is a controversial topic, with concerns about safety, nuclear waste management, and proliferation. These concerns have led some advocates of the GND and net-zero carbon goals to exclude nuclear energy from their plans. Nevertheless, others argue that a transition to a net-zero carbon economy will require a mix of energy sources, including nuclear energy, to achieve the necessary emissions reductions.

#### BING
-   Yes, there are links between nuclear energy and the green new deal and/or net zero carbon. Nuclear energy is a source of zero-carbon power and more than half of that zero-carbon capacity comes from nuclear energy¹. The International Energy Agency believes that global nuclear capacity must double by 2050 to reach net-zero emissions targets².
-   However, there are some concerns about nuclear energy. For example, the Green New Deal resolution reportedly calls for phasing out nuclear energy within 10 years if possible⁵. While the resolution does not explicitly exclude nuclear energy, a fact sheet supplied by Ocasio-Cortez's office singles it out¹.

Yes, there are links between nuclear energy and the Green New Deal and/or net zero carbon. Nuclear energy is a low-carbon energy source that produces no greenhouse gas emissions during operation[1](https://world-nuclear.org/nuclear-essentials/how-can-nuclear-combat-climate-change.aspx). Experts have concluded that in order to achieve the deep decarbonization required to keep the average rise in global temperatures to below 1.5°C, combating climate change would be much harder without an increased role for nuclear[1](https://world-nuclear.org/nuclear-essentials/how-can-nuclear-combat-climate-change.aspx). The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) states that nuclear energy is key to achieving global net zero objectives, working in partnership with renewable energy sources and other low carbon options[2](https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/21/10/nuclear-energy-for-a-net-zero-world.pdf). The IAEA believes that it is impossible to solve problems of the climate agenda without the use of nuclear energy[2](https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/21/10/nuclear-energy-for-a-net-zero-world.pdf). The International Energy Agency (IEA) also recognizes the role of nuclear energy in a clean energy system. Over the past 50 years, the use of nuclear power has reduced CO2 emissions by over 60 gigatonnes – nearly two years' worth of global energy-related emissions[3](https://www.iea.org/reports/nuclear-power-in-a-clean-energy-system). The IEA's first report addressing nuclear power in nearly two decades brings this important topic back into the global energy debate[3](https://www.iea.org/reports/nuclear-power-in-a-clean-energy-system). The report states that achieving the clean energy transition with less nuclear power is possible but would require an extraordinary effort[3](https://www.iea.org/reports/nuclear-power-in-a-clean-energy-system). Wind and solar PV would be the main sources called upon to replace nuclear, and their pace of growth would need to accelerate at an unprecedented rate[3](https://www.iea.org/reports/nuclear-power-in-a-clean-energy-system). However, the U.S. is divided over whether nuclear power is part of the green energy future[4](https://www.npr.org/2022/01/18/1073726137/the-us-is-divided-over-whether-nuclear-power-is-part-of-the-green-energy-future). While nuclear reactors have operated reliably and carbon-free for many decades, some people are concerned about the safety of nuclear power plants and the disposal of nuclear waste[4](https://www.npr.org/2022/01/18/1073726137/the-us-is-divided-over-whether-nuclear-power-is-part-of-the-green-energy-future). Despite these concerns, nuclear energy is a zero-emission clean energy source that protects air quality and has a small land footprint[5](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/3-reasons-why-nuclear-clean-and-sustainable).
