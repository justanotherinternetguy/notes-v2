# Topic 2: Net Zero Carbon
- Also called “net zero emissions” or “carbon neutrality,” is a goal set by several climate proposals, including the Green New Deal, to balance any carbon emissions with the absorption of a comparable amount of carbon from the atmosphere in order to help reduce the global temperature by 1.5°C, as directed by the Paris Agreement. Net zero emissions can be achieved via offsets like tree-planting programs, carbon capture technologies, 100% renewable or clean energy plans, and other methods. Most plans call for net zero by 2050, though some set goals or benchmarks for earlier. As of September 25th, 2019, over 60 countries had committed to net zero carbon, accounting to 11% of global emissions. The biggest carbon emitters (China, United States, and India) had not committed.

## What does NZC actually mean?
- Amount of carbon emissions released into the atmosphere is **balanced** by the amount of carbon removed from the atmosphere
- Reducing GG. emissions to as close to 0 as possible, then using carbon removal methods [1]
- Mitigates the effects of climate change

## Current Legislature
- Paris Agreement [2]
- UK Climate Change Act [3]
- European Green Deal [4]
- California Assembly Bill 32 (*Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006*) [5]

## Similarities
- NZC
- Achieve NZC by 2050
- Reduce GG emissions
- Require international cooperation

## What must be done?
- Reducing fossil fuel use: This includes transitioning to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower, as well as improving energy efficiency and reducing energy waste.
- Electrifying transportation: This means transitioning to electric vehicles and increasing the use of public transportation and active transportation (walking, biking, etc.).
- Implementing carbon capture and storage: This involves capturing carbon dioxide emissions from industrial processes and storing them in geological formations or using them in products.
- Reforestation and afforestation: Planting new forests and restoring degraded ones can help remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in trees and soil.
- Reducing industrial emissions: This includes implementing low-carbon manufacturing processes and increasing the use of recycled materials.

## Obstacles
- Political and economic barriers: Many policies and regulations needed to achieve net zero carbon face opposition from industries and politicians with vested interests in the status quo.
- Technological limitations: Some low-carbon technologies, such as carbon capture and storage, are still in the early stages of development and may not be available on a large scale for some time.
- High costs: Some of the technologies and measures required to achieve net zero carbon come with high costs, which may be a barrier for some countries and communities.
- Limited public awareness and engagement: Many people are still unaware of the urgency of addressing climate change, or they may not be motivated to take action themselves.

# What does “net zero carbon” actually mean?
#### CHATGPT
-   "Net zero carbon" means achieving a balance between the amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced and the amount removed from the atmosphere. It involves reducing emissions as much as possible, and then offsetting the remaining emissions by supporting activities that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, such as reforestation, afforestation, or carbon capture and storage.
-   In other words, net zero carbon is achieved when the amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced by human activity is equal to the amount removed from the atmosphere, resulting in no additional increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This is important because greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, trap heat in the atmosphere and contribute to global warming, which can have devastating effects on the planet and its ecosystems.

#### BING
Net zero carbon means that any carbon emissions created are balanced by taking the same amount out of the atmosphere. So we’ll reach net zero when the amount of carbon emissions we add is no more than the amount taken away ¹. This can be done naturally, such as by restoring forests that absorb CO2 out of the air, or by using technology that can capture and store emissions or directly pull CO2 from the atmosphere ⁵.

Net zero carbon refers to a state in which the greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere are balanced by removal out of the atmosphere[1](https://netzeroclimate.org/what-is-net-zero/)[2](https://plana.earth/academy/what-is-difference-between-carbon-neutral-net-zero-climate-positive)[4](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/quick-questions/what-do-carbon-neutral-and-net-zero-mean.html). The term net zero is important because, for CO2 at least, this is the state at which global warming stops[1](https://netzeroclimate.org/what-is-net-zero/). Net-zero carbon emissions mean that an activity releases net-zero carbon emissions into the atmosphere[2](https://plana.earth/academy/what-is-difference-between-carbon-neutral-net-zero-climate-positive). Net-zero emissions balance the whole amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) released and the amount removed from the atmosphere[2](https://plana.earth/academy/what-is-difference-between-carbon-neutral-net-zero-climate-positive). Carbon neutral and net zero are two similar terms, but they have different meanings[2](https://plana.earth/academy/what-is-difference-between-carbon-neutral-net-zero-climate-positive)[3](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/08/carbon-neutral-net-zero-sustainability-climate-change/)[4](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/quick-questions/what-do-carbon-neutral-and-net-zero-mean.html). Carbon neutral means that an activity releases net-zero carbon emissions into the atmosphere[2](https://plana.earth/academy/what-is-difference-between-carbon-neutral-net-zero-climate-positive)[4](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/quick-questions/what-do-carbon-neutral-and-net-zero-mean.html). Net-zero carbon means no carbon was emitted from the beginning, so no carbon needs to be captured or offset[2](https://plana.earth/academy/what-is-difference-between-carbon-neutral-net-zero-climate-positive). Net-zero emissions refer to the overall balance of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) produced and GHG emissions taken out[2](https://plana.earth/academy/what-is-difference-between-carbon-neutral-net-zero-climate-positive)[4](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/quick-questions/what-do-carbon-neutral-and-net-zero-mean.html). Net zero is broader and covers more than just carbon[3](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/08/carbon-neutral-net-zero-sustainability-climate-change/). To achieve net zero, emissions need to be reduced, and carbon dioxide needs to be removed from the atmosphere through technologies that actively take in carbon dioxide or by enhancing natural removal methods, such as planting trees[4](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/quick-questions/what-do-carbon-neutral-and-net-zero-mean.html). Net zero is an essential action to combat climate change[3](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/08/carbon-neutral-net-zero-sustainability-climate-change/). The Paris Agreement underlines the need for net zero, requiring states to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases[1](https://netzeroclimate.org/what-is-net-zero/).

## Many pieces of legislation and agreements have attempted to implement “net zero carbon”. Which ones have done this? Are there any similarities?


#### CHATGPT
  
  

There have been many pieces of legislation and agreements around the world that have attempted to implement "net zero carbon" targets. Some of the major ones include:
1. Paris Agreement: This is an international agreement adopted in 2015 by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) that aims to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C. The agreement calls for countries to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in the second half of this century.
2. European Green Deal: This is the European Union's flagship initiative to make Europe climate neutral by 2050. The European Green Deal includes a commitment to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, as well as a series of measures to reduce emissions across various sectors.
3. UK Climate Change Act: This is a UK law passed in 2008 that sets legally binding targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The law requires the UK to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, with interim targets along the way.
4. US Climate Leadership and Environmental Action for our Nation's (CLEAN) Future Act: This is a proposed US federal law that seeks to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The bill includes measures to reduce emissions across various sectors and provides funding for research and development of clean energy technologies.
5. Race to Zero Campaign: This is a global campaign launched in 2020 that aims to rally leadership and support from businesses, cities, regions, and investors for a healthy, resilient, zero-carbon recovery that prevents future threats, creates decent jobs, and unlocks inclusive, sustainable growth. Participants commit to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 at the latest.
There are some similarities between these initiatives in terms of their goal to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, the timeline for achieving this goal, and the focus on reducing emissions across various sectors. However, the specifics of how these goals are to be achieved vary between different initiatives, depending on the particular policy priorities and circumstances of each country or region.

#### BING
There are several pieces of legislation and agreements that have attempted to implement “net zero carbon”. For example, the **European Climate Law** sets a legally binding target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050³. Similarly, President Biden has set a target for the United States to achieve a 50-52 percent reduction from 2005 levels in economy-wide net greenhouse gas pollution in 2030¹.

#### PERPLEX
Many countries and organizations have set goals to achieve net-zero carbon emissions. More than a hundred countries have joined an alliance aiming for net-zero emissions by 2050, including Argentina, which pledged to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and cap its 2030 emissions unconditionally at 359 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) [1](https://www.climatechangenews.com/2019/06/14/countries-net-zero-climate-goal/). Scotland's devolved parliament is working on a bill to reach net-zero in 2045, based on its strong renewable energy resources and capacity to store CO2[1](https://www.climatechangenews.com/2019/06/14/countries-net-zero-climate-goal/). The United States is also aiming to reach net-zero carbon emissions by around mid-century, removing and storing as much carbon dioxide from the air as we put into the atmosphere[2](https://www.wri.org/initiatives/carbon-removal). The terms "net-zero" and "carbon neutral" both refer to the balance of emitted greenhouse gases (GHGs) with avoided or removed emissions. However, the distinguishing factor between the two claims hinges on compensated emissions (aka offsets). A business can claim carbon neutrality by measuring its emissions and then offsetting the balance through financed projects outside of its value chain, without actually reducing its own emissions. Net-zero, on the other hand, does not permit financed emissions, which compels companies to more meaningfully reduce value chain emissions[3](https://www.sustain.life/blog/difference-between-net-zero-carbon-neutral). To achieve net-zero carbon emissions, a balance of carbon emission reductions and more carbon sinks such as forests is required[4](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20211028-why-not-all-net-zero-emissions-targets-are-equal). Strategies to achieve net-zero carbon emissions include balancing the total amount of carbon dioxide or greenhouse gas emissions produced directly or indirectly by a country, company, product, activity, or individual over a certain period via carbon offset or removal initiatives[5](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10311-022-01435-8). The Science Based Targets initiative's Corporate Net-Zero Standard formally defined net-zero in late 2021 to specifically state that compensation is not permitted[3](https://www.sustain.life/blog/difference-between-net-zero-carbon-neutral).

## What would need to be done to reach net zero carbon? What obstacles exist to reaching net zero carbon?

#### CHATGPT
-   Reaching net-zero carbon means that the amount of carbon dioxide emissions released into the atmosphere is balanced by the amount removed from the atmosphere. To achieve this, several measures need to be taken, including:
-   1. Switching to renewable energy sources: Renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power can help reduce carbon emissions.
-   2. Energy efficiency improvements: Improved energy efficiency in buildings, transportation, and industry can significantly reduce the amount of energy consumed, and thus the amount of carbon emissions produced.
-   3. Carbon capture and storage: Technologies that capture carbon dioxide emissions and store them underground can help reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
-   4. Afforestation and reforestation: Planting trees and restoring forests can absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
-   5. Shift to sustainable agriculture: Sustainable agricultural practices, such as regenerative agriculture, can help reduce emissions from the agriculture sector and increase the amount of carbon stored in the soil.
-   However, several obstacles exist in reaching net-zero carbon, including:
-   1. The high cost of renewable energy sources: Switching to renewable energy sources can be expensive, and some countries may not have the resources to make the necessary investments.
-   2. Political opposition: In some cases, political opposition can prevent the implementation of policies that support the transition to renewable energy sources.
-   3. Limited availability of carbon capture and storage technologies: Carbon capture and storage technologies are still in the early stages of development, and there are few facilities capable of implementing them on a large scale.
-   4. Lack of public awareness and engagement: Many people are not fully aware of the impact of their daily activities on the environment and may not be willing to change their behavior to reduce carbon emissions.
-   5. Dependence on fossil fuels: Many countries are heavily dependent on fossil fuels, and it can be difficult to transition away from them without causing economic disruption.


#### BING
-   To reach net zero carbon, the world will need to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius by around 2050, which means that the planet’s total greenhouse gas emissions will need to decline to net-zero². Some of the obstacles to reaching net zero carbon include high costs and insufficient budget¹, and the need for deep-dive modeling of complex interacting human and natural systems².

To reach net zero carbon, there are several critical priorities that need to be addressed[1](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2022/11/04/getting-back-on-track-to-net-zero-three-critical-priorities-for-cop27). First, it is essential to limit further temperature rises to 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius by cutting emissions by 25-50% by 2030 compared to pre-2019 levels[1](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2022/11/04/getting-back-on-track-to-net-zero-three-critical-priorities-for-cop27). Second, there is a need for steadfast policies to reach net zero by 2050, strong measures to adapt to global warming that is already locked in, and staunch financial support to help vulnerable countries pay for these efforts[1](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2022/11/04/getting-back-on-track-to-net-zero-three-critical-priorities-for-cop27). Third, the energy sector, which contributes about 73% of global greenhouse gas emissions, must decarbonize at an unprecedented pace[3](https://globalchange.mit.edu/news-media/jp-news-outreach/global-net-zero-emissions-goals-challenges-and-opportunities). Fourth, annual clean energy investment worldwide will need to more than triple by 2030 to around $4 trillion[4](https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050). One of the obstacles to reaching net zero carbon is the gap between net-zero rhetoric and reality[1](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2022/11/04/getting-back-on-track-to-net-zero-three-critical-priorities-for-cop27). While about 140 countries, accounting for 91% of greenhouse gas emissions, have already proposed or set net-zero targets for around mid-century, current global climate targets would only deliver an 11% reduction in emissions by 2030 compared to pre-2019 levels[1](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2022/11/04/getting-back-on-track-to-net-zero-three-critical-priorities-for-cop27). Therefore, most countries need to do even more to strengthen their targets for cutting emissions, particularly large economies[1](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2022/11/04/getting-back-on-track-to-net-zero-three-critical-priorities-for-cop27). Another obstacle is the high cost of transitioning to net zero carbon, which is a major blocker for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) [5](https://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/insights/the-top-three-challenges-businesses-face-to-get-to-net-zero.html). Around 40% of the SMEs surveyed for a report said that high costs and insufficient budget were major blockers to becoming net-zero emitters[5](https://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/insights/the-top-three-challenges-businesses-face-to-get-to-net-zero.html). In conclusion, reaching net zero carbon requires limiting further temperature rises, steadfast policies, strong measures to adapt to global warming, financial support, decarbonizing the energy sector, and clean energy investment[1](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2022/11/04/getting-back-on-track-to-net-zero-three-critical-priorities-for-cop27)[3](https://globalchange.mit.edu/news-media/jp-news-outreach/global-net-zero-emissions-goals-challenges-and-opportunities)[4](https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050). However, there are obstacles to reaching net zero carbon, such as the gap between net-zero rhetoric and reality and the high cost of transitioning to net zero carbon, which is a major blocker for SMEs[1](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2022/11/04/getting-back-on-track-to-net-zero-three-critical-priorities-for-cop27)[5](https://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/insights/the-top-three-challenges-businesses-face-to-get-to-net-zero.html).
