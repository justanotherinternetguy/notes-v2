# Topic 2: Net Zero Carbon
- Also called “net zero emissions” or “carbon neutrality,” is a goal set by several climate proposals, including the Green New Deal, to balance any carbon emissions with the absorption of a comparable amount of carbon from the atmosphere in order to help reduce the global temperature by 1.5°C, as directed by the Paris Agreement. Net zero emissions can be achieved via offsets like tree-planting programs, carbon capture technologies, 100% renewable or clean energy plans, and other methods. Most plans call for net zero by 2050, though some set goals or benchmarks for earlier. As of September 25th, 2019, over 60 countries had committed to net zero carbon, accounting to 11% of global emissions. The biggest carbon emitters (China, United States, and India) had not committed.


- What does “net zero carbon” actually mean? Many pieces of legislation and agreements have attempted to implement “net zero carbon”. Which ones have done this? Are there any similarities?
- What would need to be done to reach net zero carbon? What obstacles exist to reaching net zero carbon?  


## What does NZC actually mean?
- Amount of carbon emissions released into the atmosphere is **balanced** by the amount of carbon removed from the atmosphere
- Reducing GG. emissions to as close to 0 as possible, then using carbon removal methods [1]
- Mitigates the effects of climate change

## Current Legislature
- Paris Agreement [2]
- UK Climate Change Act [3]
- European Green Deal [4]
- California Assembly Bill 32 (*Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006*) [5]

## Similarities
- NZC
- Achieve NZC by 2050
- Reduce GG emissions
- Require international cooperation

## What must be done?
- Reducing fossil fuel use: This includes transitioning to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower, as well as improving energy efficiency and reducing energy waste.
- Electrifying transportation: This means transitioning to electric vehicles and increasing the use of public transportation and active transportation (walking, biking, etc.).
- Implementing carbon capture and storage: This involves capturing carbon dioxide emissions from industrial processes and storing them in geological formations or using them in products.
- Reforestation and afforestation: Planting new forests and restoring degraded ones can help remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in trees and soil.
- Reducing industrial emissions: This includes implementing low-carbon manufacturing processes and increasing the use of recycled materials.

## Obstacles
- Political and economic barriers: Many policies and regulations needed to achieve net zero carbon face opposition from industries and politicians with vested interests in the status quo.
- Technological limitations: Some low-carbon technologies, such as carbon capture and storage, are still in the early stages of development and may not be available on a large scale for some time.
- High costs: Some of the technologies and measures required to achieve net zero carbon come with high costs, which may be a barrier for some countries and communities.
- Limited public awareness and engagement: Many people are still unaware of the urgency of addressing climate change, or they may not be motivated to take action themselves.
