## Mole (mol)
$$\text{Avogadro's Number} = 6.022 \times 10^{23} \text{particles}$$
- SI unit for **amount of a substance**
- Equal to $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ particles of a substance
	- Elements = Atoms (1 mol Ca = $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ atoms of Ca)
	- Compounds = Molecules (1 mol $H_2O$ = $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ molecules of $H_2O$)
- **Atoms** in $Al_2(SO_4)_3$ = (2 $Al$) + (3 $S$) + (12 $O$) = 17 atoms
- **Ions** in $Al_2(SO_4)_3$ = (2 $Al$) + (3 $SO_4$) = 5 ions
- Mass (grams) are impractical - elements have different atomic masses
- Moles will show the **amount** of things you have


## Average Atomic Mass
- AMU = $\frac{1}{12}$ of Carbon-12 atom
## Molar Mass (g/mol)
- Mass per mole of a substance
- Calculation
	- $\Sigma$ (Number of atoms of each element $\times$ atomic mass of each element)
- Rounded to **hundredths**

## Types of Chemical Reactions
## Synthesis (A + B $\to$ AB)

## Decomposition (AB $\to$ A + B)
- `B` is usually heat or energy
- A compound breaks into 2+ simpler substances due to the addition of energy
- **SPECIAL REACTIONS:**
	- Metallic Carbonate $\to$ Metallic Oxide +  Carbon Dioxide
		- $MCO_3 (s) \to MO (s) + CO_2 (g)$
	- Metallic Chlorate $\to$ Metallic Chloride + Oxygen
		- $MClO_3 (s) \to MCl(s) + 3O_2 (g)$
	- Metallic Hydroxides $\to$ Metallix Oxides + Water

# Unit 7
## Vocab
- Solute = A substance that is **being dissolved**
- Solvent = A substance that is **doing the dissolving**
- Solution = **Homogeneous** mixture of solute dissolved in a solvent
- Solubility = The **maximum** amount of solute able to dissolve in a **given amount** of solvent at a **certain temperature**
	- Solubility of **solids will increase** at **high temperatures**
	- Solubility of **gases will instead** at **low temperatures**
- **Colloid** = A **heterogeneous** mixture of **intermediate sized particles** (milk, jello, blood)
- **Suspension** = A **heterogeneous** mixture that contains particles that will **separate over time**
- **Miscible** = **Liquids** that dissolve in each other

## Solubility
- **Water**
	- **Emergent properties of water**
		- Adhesion
		- Cohesion
		- Surface tension
		- High specific heat
		- High heat of vaporization
		- Universal solvent
		- Ice floats
- **Solubility**
	- "Like dissolves like"
		- Polar compounds dissolve in polar solvents
			- Polar covalent + ALL ionic
		- Nonpolar compounds dissolve in nonpolar solvents

## Polarity Check
- Does the central atom have lone pairs?
	- **Yes** = POLAR
	- **No** = Are the terminal atoms the same?
		- **Yes** = NONPOLAR
		- **No** = Are polar bonds present?
			- **Yes** = POLAR
			- **No** = NONPOLAR
![](Pasted%20image%2020230610103607.png)
- Polar molecules have **partial charges**
- Ionic (Metal + Nonmetal OR anything + polyatomic) have **full positive and negative charges**

## Hydrogen Bonding
- H + [N, O, F]
- Intermolecular force
- DNA base pairs, Water's relatively high melting and boiling point, Ice expands
- ![](Pasted%20image%2020230610095054.png)
- Takes **relatively large** amount of energy to break
- Upon reaching ice, the hydrogen bonds stabilize and arrange water molecules farther from each other
## Rate of Dissolution
- Stirring will make something dissolve faster
- Larger surface area (chunk of salt vs small grains)
	- Larger surface area = faster dissolution
- Temperature impacts **solubility** (AMOUNT of solute that can be dissolved)

## Dissolution and Solvation ![](Pasted%20image%2020230610110035.png)
- **Solvation** = Process by which solvent molecules surround and interact with solute ions or molecules

## Solubility Graph/Curve
- Graphs that display the **maximum** amount of solute dissolvable in an amount of solution at a particular temperature
- **Saturated**
	- T/S lands on the curve
	- If any more solute is added, a **precipitate will form**
- **Unsaturated**
	- T/S is below curve
	- Still possible to add more solute
- **Supersaturated**
	- T/S is above the curve
	- More solute than there should be
	- Achieved by saturating a solvent at a higher temperature and then cooling the solution down
	- You can recrystallize supersaturated solutions by adding a **seed crystal**

## Solubility and the Ocean
- Ocean absorbs 50% of carbon emissions and has absorbed 90% of the increased heat due to global warming
	- As the ocean warms...
		- It absorbs more salts and chemicals that will **harm marine life**
		- Leaks $CO_2$ from oceans
			- Increased melting sea ice dredges $CO_2$-rich deep ocean waters to the surface
			- $CO_2$ is a gas, so it becomes less soluble at higher temperatures (fizzy soda)
## Temperature and the Ocean
- Denser water sinks, less dense water rises
- **Global Conveyor Belt/Thermohaline Circulation**
	- Warm salty water sinks
	- Cycles nutrients
	- 1000 years
	- TC will **slow down** in the 21st century but will not undergo an abrupt transition
	- Slowing will have a minor **cooling effect**

## Molarity (Molar Concentration) (M)
- Number of moles of solute/Liters of solution
$$\text{Molarity} = \frac{\text{mol solute}}{\text{L of solution}}$$
- M > 1 = Concentrated
- M < 1 = Diluted

$$M_1V_1 = M_2V_2$$
- $M_1$ = Original molarity
- $V_1$ = Original volume
- $M_2$ = Diluted molarity
- $V_2$ = Total final volume

![](Pasted%20image%2020230610111822.png)

## Percent Mass
$$\text{Percent Mass} = \frac{\text{Mass of Solute}}{\text{Mass of ENTIRE Solution}} \times 100$$

## PPM
- `x` grams of solute per 1,000,000 g solution
- The same goes with PPB
$$\frac{\text{ppm}}{10,000} = \text{Percent Mass}$$
- Do NOT need to convert percent mass into a decimal

## Saturation vs. Concentration
- NO RELATIONSHIP
- **Saturation** = Maximum amount of a solute able to dissolve in a given amount of solvent at a certain temperature
	- Dependent on **amount** and **type** of solute
- **Concentration** = Description of how much solvent compared to amount solute
	- Only dependent on **amount** of solute



# Unit 8
- **Cycle** =  Transformation of a particular element or elements from one form to another
	- Repetitive and constant
	- Carbon, Water, Nitrogen, Sulfur, Phosphorus, Oxygen
- Types of Organisms
	- **Producer** = Takes energy directly from the sun and converts it into usable food and fuel for **other organisms** (plants, algae, some bacteria)
	- **Consumers** = Consume producers or other consumers (heterotrophs, humans)
	- **Decomposers** = Consume the decaying and dying parts of other organisms and return their matter back into abiotic matter (bacteria, fungi)
- Compounds in **greatest abundance**
	- Earth's surface (solid) = Silicates (quartz) - rocks
	- **Water** is most abundant overall
	- Weathering and erosion of different materials by weather and wind can cause the matter found in the crust to be **used by other organisms**
		- Makes oceans salty
- **Biotic** = Describes the living things and matter in the environment **used directly** by those living things
	- **Organic** = Contains **carbon and hydrogen** most likely to be used in living things (though not necessarily)
- **Abiotic** = Inorganic, nonliving parts of the Earth (rocks, air)
- **Residence time** = Amount of time each substance "stays" in one of the sphere of Earth
	- Residence time of 1 CFC molecule **in the atmosphere**is 50-100 years
- **Reservoir** = Place where a lot of particular element is stored
	- Largest aluminium reservoir is rocks containing **bauxite**

## Carbon Cycle
![](Pasted%20image%2020230609212740.png)
- **Biotic Movement (Fast Carbon Cycle)**
	- Psyn
		- Plants take $CO_2$ out of the atmosphere to make **glucose**
		- $6H_2O + 6CO_2 + \text{sunlight} \to C_6H_12O_6 + 6O_2$
	- Cell Resp
		- Plants and animals release $CO_2$ into the atmosphere when converting glucose to ATP
		- $C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2 \to 6H_2O + 6CO_2 + \text{ATP}$
	- Decomposition of animal/plant waste
		- Release $CO_2$, water nutrients, and energy
- **Abiotic Movement**
	- Volcanic outgassing of $CO_2$
	- Burning biomass and fossil fuels
	- Dissolving $CO_2$ into the ocean
	- **Slow Carbon Cycle**
		- Process of moving carbon between rocks, soil, oceans, and the atmosphere
		- 100-200 million years to complete
		- Atmospheric carbon dissolved into ocean water to form **carbonic acid**($H_2CO_3$)
		- Carbonic acid falls (as acid rain) on rocks and dissolves the rocks
		- This forms **ions** such as **calcium**
		- These ions flow into rivers and into the ocean
		- In the ocean, calcium ion react with **carbonate** and product **calcium carbonate** ($CaCO_3$)
		- Calcium carbonate makes up the shells of marine organisms
		- When these organisms die, they sink to the bottom of the ocean where sediment will bury and store the carbon in **limestone**
- **Human Impact**
	- Burning of fossil fuels --> releases too much carbon
		- **Carbon sequestration** = A process that allows humans to "trap" some  of the additional carbon we have been releasing
	- **Deforestation** = Tree take in $CO_2$ that is in the atmosphere
		- Fewer trees = Less $CO_2$ being taken out of atmosphere
		- Release large amounts of $CO_2$ stored in trees


## Oxygen Cycle
![](Pasted%20image%2020230609214647.png)
- **Emergent properties of water**
	- Adhesion
	- Cohesion
	- Surface tension
	- High specific heat
	- High heat of vaporization
	- Universal solvent
	- Ice floats
- **Processes**
	- Evaporation = L --> G = Oceans, lakes, rivers --> atmosphere
	- Transpiration = L --> G = Release of water **by trees**
		- Stomata
	- Condensation = G --> L = Forming clouds when dew point is reached (saturation limit)
		- Clouds form when aerosols (dust, salt, pollutants) allows water to have a condensation nucleus
	- Precipitation = G --> L = Return of water to ground
	- Evapotranspiration = Combined release of water from surface bodies of water, evaporation in soil, and transpiration from plants
- **Freshwater**
