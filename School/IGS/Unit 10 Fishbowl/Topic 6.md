- Carbon Pricing is a market-based strategy to control the rise of greehouse gases. Under a carbon pricing scenario, companies are charged for the carbon they emit, either through a carbon tax, which sets a direct cost for greenhouse gas emissions or the carbon content of fossil fuels, or a “cap and trade” system, which puts a limit (cap) on the amount of greenhouse gas emissions a company can emit and allows lower emitters to sell their extra emissions allowance to higher emitters. Proponents of carbon pricing argue that putting a market-based price on emissions can not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but by allowing emitters to choose how to reduce their emissions, carbon pricing can create competitive innovation in the field, benefitting climate change plans. Opponents of carbon pricing argue that taxes and cap and trade programs penalize those without the financial resources to switch to renewable energies, could result in higher costs for consumers, and carbon pricing creates a system to be gamed by lobbyists, resulting in no change in emissions.

Carbon pricing is a policy tool used to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by placing a price on carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gas emissions. There are two main forms of carbon pricing: carbon taxes and cap-and-trade systems. Here are some examples of carbon pricing policies currently in use around the world:

1.  British Columbia's carbon tax: In 2008, British Columbia became the first jurisdiction in North America to implement a carbon tax. The tax applies to the purchase and use of all fossil fuels and is currently set at $40 per tonne of CO2. The revenue generated from the tax is used to fund various climate action programs. Studies have shown that the tax has been successful in reducing emissions without harming the economy.
    
2.  European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS): The EU ETS is the world's largest cap-and-trade system, covering more than 11,000 power plants and industrial facilities in 31 countries. The system sets a cap on the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions that covered entities can emit, and emissions allowances are bought and sold in a market-based system. The EU ETS has faced criticism for having an oversupply of allowances, leading to a low carbon price and limited emissions reductions.
    
3.  California's cap-and-trade program: California's cap-and-trade program covers emissions from the state's power sector, industrial facilities, and transportation sector. The program sets a declining cap on emissions and allows companies to buy and sell allowances in a market-based system. The program has been successful in reducing emissions, but there have been concerns about the high cost of allowances and the potential for leakage of emissions to other states or countries.
    
4.  South Korea's emissions trading system: South Korea's emissions trading system was launched in 2015 and covers emissions from the power, industry, and buildings sectors. The program sets a cap on emissions and allows companies to buy and sell allowances in a market-based system. The program has been criticized for having a low carbon price and for providing too many free allowances to covered entities.
    

Overall, the success of carbon pricing policies depends on a variety of factors, including the design of the policy, the specific context in which it is implemented, and the level of political support for the policy. Some carbon pricing policies have been successful in reducing emissions while others have faced challenges or criticisms.

## Does putting a price on carbon emissions allow companies to “buy their way out” of breaking climate pledges and outputting excess emissions? Is carbon pricing fair for already-marginalized consumers and those who are already struggling financially? 

#### CHATGPT
Carbon pricing is a mechanism that puts a cost on greenhouse gas emissions to discourage companies from producing excess emissions. While it may not directly allow companies to "buy their way out" of breaking climate pledges, it can provide an economic incentive for them to reduce their emissions and shift towards more sustainable practices.

However, it is also true that carbon pricing can have a disproportionate impact on marginalized consumers and those who are already struggling financially. In some cases, these groups may bear a greater burden of the costs associated with carbon pricing, such as higher prices for goods and services that rely on emissions-intensive inputs.

To address this concern, some carbon pricing policies include measures to redistribute revenues or provide financial assistance to low-income households. These measures can help ensure that the costs of carbon pricing are distributed more fairly and do not exacerbate existing inequalities.

It is worth noting that carbon pricing is just one tool among many that can be used to address climate change. Other strategies, such as regulations, subsidies, and investments in clean energy technologies, may also be necessary to achieve deep emissions reductions while promoting economic growth and equity.
