# 11a - Terrestrial Planets
- **Solar system** = A system of celestial bodies orbiting around a sun/star
- Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, (Ceres), Asteroid Belt Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, (Pluto), (Makemke), Kupier Belt, (Eris)
- **Accretion disk** = **Clockwise** revolution in solar system
	- Always follows direction of initial accretion disk
- **Our Sun**
	- Closest star
	- Our sun holds 99.8% of the solar system's total mass
	- 109x diameter of Earth
	- **Photosphere** = visible surface of Sun
		- $6,700^{\circ}C$
		- 500km thick
		- **Sunspots** = Cooler, darker areas where loops of the Sun's magnetic field break through the surface and disrupt the transfer of heat in the sun
			- **Intense magnetic activity**
- **Our Moon**
	- Small, once molten, surface cooled too quickly for tectonic plates to form
	- **Craters** = bombarded by asteroids
	- No atmosphere
		- No weather
		- No protection from asteroids
		- $123^{\circ}C$ to $-233^{\circ}C$
	- Earth's only natural satellite
- **Terrestrial (Inner) vs. Jovian (Outer) Planets**
|Inner|Outer|
|-----|-----|
|Made of $Fe$ and silicates|Made of $H$, $He$ (lighter elements), **no solid surfaces**|
|Form near **center of accretion disk**|Formed near **edge of accretion disk**|
|Heavier elements are drawn to each other and the greater force of gravity at the **center** of accretion disk|Lighter elements are able to escape the gravitational pull of the accretion disk, elements have smaller masses and form farther away|
- Terrestrial planets were much hotter when they were formed, cooled w/ time
- Any Jovian planet's core **is denser** than any terrestrial planet
- **Terrestrial Planets** (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars)
	- Rocky/solid surface
	- Closer to sun
	- Iron silicates 
	- Cores are $Fe$ and $Ni$
	- More dense than water (highest density planets)
	- Relatively close orbits to each other
	- Smaller masses and radii
	- Higher density
	- Slower rotation
	- Relatively small magnetic field
	- Relatively few moons

	- **Mercury**
		- Similar to density as Earth, Mercury is smaller
		- **Similar appearance to Earth's moon** but **no evidence of lava flow**
		- Closest planet to sun
		- No atmosphere
			- Constantly bombarded by asteroids
		- 0.5% strength of Earth's magnetic field (weak)
		- No axis tilt
		- No moons
		- Side facing sun reaches $700{^\circ}F$
		- Side facing away reaches $-300^{\circ}F$
		- Density = $5.44 \; g/cm^3$
		- Atmosphere: None (Traces of $H$, $He$, $Na$, $K$)
		- Rotates once on its axis every 60 days
		- Revolves around sun every 88 days
		- Axial tile = $0^{\circ}$
		- Moons: None

		- Distance: 0.387 AU
		- Diameter: 0.38 Earth
	- **Venus**
		- **Inhospitable** planets
		- Extreme winds, thick clouds, runaway **greenhouse effect**
		- Surface temps average $470^{\circ}F$
		- Significant volcanic outgassing
		- No magnetic field
		- **Similar density and size** as Earth
		- Extremely **dense atmosphere** containing 95% $CO_2$ (GHG)
			- Appearing to be rotating opposite of other planets
			- Rotation speed is **slowing down**
				- May become eventually **tidally locked** (same face is always towards the sun, **rotation = revolution**)
				- Our **Moon is tidally locked**
		- **Tidal lock**
			- Mercury (to Sun)
			- Venus (**eventually**)
			- Moon (to Earth)
			- Callisto (to Jupiter)
		- Density: $5.3 \; g/cm^3$
		- Diameter: 0.95 Earth
		- Distance: 0.723 AU
		- Atmosphere: 96.5% $CO_2$, 3.5% $N_2$
		- Rotation: 243 days
		- Revolution: 225 days
		- Axial tilt: $177^{\circ}$ (appearance of rotating clockwise)
		- Composition: Unknown, crust believed to be similar to Earth
	- **Earth**
		- **Radiation Environment**
			- Bands of rapidly moving charged particles trapped by Earth's magnetic field in **toroidal regions** surrounding the equator
			- **Van Allan radiation belts**
				- Zones of energetic charged particles, most of which originate from the **solar wind**, that are captured by and held around a planet by that planet's **magnetosphere**
				- **Endanger satellites**, which must have their sensitive components protected with adequate shielding if they enter the belts
	- **Mars**
		- **Identical geological composition** as Earth
		- **Thin** atmosphere ($CO_2$)
