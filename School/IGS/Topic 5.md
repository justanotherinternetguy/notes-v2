Carbon footprints are the total amount of greenhouse gases (including CO2 and CH4) that are generated by our actions. The average carbon footprint for a person in the United States is 16 tons, one of the highest rates in the world. Globally, the average carbon footprint is closer to 4 tons. People, products and entire industries have carbon footprints. Your personal footprint includes emissions from a variety of sources — your daily commute, the food you eat, the clothes you buy, everything you throw away ... and more. The larger your footprint, the heavier the strain on the environment.

## Who, or what, created the idea of a carbon footprint?

#### CHATGPT
-   The concept of a "carbon footprint" was first introduced in a 2004 academic paper by two British consultants, Professor John Barrett and Craig Simmons. The paper, titled "Carbon Footprints: A Review of Current Knowledge and Applications," defined a carbon footprint as "the total set of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused directly and indirectly by an individual, organization, event or product."
-   Since then, the term has gained widespread use and recognition, becoming a popular way to quantify the environmental impact of human activities in terms of their greenhouse gas emissions. The concept has been expanded to include not just carbon dioxide, but also other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide.

#### BING
-   The concept and name of the carbon footprint were derived from the ecological footprint concept¹. The term “carbon footprint” is often attributed to **Mathis Wackernagel**, a Swiss-born regional planner, and **William Rees**, a Canadian ecologist, when they wrote a book in 1995 titled **Our Ecological Footprint: Reducing Human Impact on the Earth**³.

The idea of a carbon footprint was popularized by an advertising campaign of the fossil fuel company BP in 2005, designed by Ogilvy[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_footprint)[2](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/23/big-oil-coined-carbon-footprints-to-blame-us-for-their-greed-keep-them-on-the-hook). The campaign instructed people to calculate their personal carbon footprints and provided ways for people to "go on a low-carbon diet"[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_footprint). The term "carbon footprint" refers to a certain amount of gaseous emissions that are relevant to climate change and associated with human production or consumption activities[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_footprint). The concept of carbon footprint measurement has evolved over time, and it is related to the older idea of ecological footprint[3](https://www.britannica.com/science/carbon-footprint).

## How, if at all, are carbon footprints relevant today?
