- **Cosmology** = Study of how the universe started, what it was made of, and how it changes
- **Big Bang Theory**

## The Big Bang
- **15 Bya** = Single point = **Singularity**
	- **Infinitely dense** and packed with matter
- **13.8 Bya** = Birth of universe
	- Occurs in a fraction of a second
- Resulted in **matter, energy, space, and time**
	- Everything expanded, temperature **dropped**
- **Comic inflation** = Idea that the very early universe went through a period of **accelerated exponential expansion** during the first $10^{-43}$ of a second
	- $10^{-43} = \text{Planck Second}$
	- Time it took for the universe to expand from atom --> baseball
		- $1\times 10^{-10} m$ to $0.075m$
	- **Speed of expansion** = $7.5 \times 10^{41} m/s$

## Timeline
- $10^{-43}$ = Planck Second
	- Universe expands from atom to grapefruit
- $10^{-32}$ = Cosmic inflation Ends
	- During inflation, it was **too hot** for **subatomic** particles to exist = no atoms
- $10^{-6}$ = Protons + Neutrons form
- $100s$ = Deuterium, $He$, $Li$ are synthesized through fusion
- 300,000 years = Universe cools
	- **Cosmic Microwave Background** = Universe filled with **short-wavelength electromagnetic radiation** that would result in **long-wavelength radiation**
- 100 million years = First stars
	- **Most massive stars** = Short lifetimes, blue in color
- 500 million year = Oldest galaxy
- 4 billion years = Star formation peaks
- 13.8 billion years = Present day

## Structure of Universe
- Mostly empty (**void**)
- **Filaments** = Places with relatively large masses (gravity)

## Types of Galaxies
![](Pasted%20image%2020230604014753.png)

### Barred Spiral (SB*)
- Rectangular bar in center
- 2 Spiral arms

### Spiral (S*)
- 2+ spiral arms
- No elongated center

### Elliptical (E*)
- Spherical to oblong
- **Little** gas/dust, **few** new star formation
- Object **do not** move in orderly fashion = **Many** stellar collisions

### Lenticular (S0)
- Hybrid between spiral and elliptical
- Central bulge + some stars in a hallo
- **No** spiral arms

### Irregular
- No defined shape

### Peculiar
- Results from **collision** of two smaller galaxies
- **Active** galactic nuclei

## Hubble Classification
![](Pasted%20image%2020230604015102.png)
- **Erroneously** believed to be the "evolution" of galaxies
- Actually, galaxies **rarely** change their shape

## Galactic Nuclei
- Centers of galaxies can be active (light is being emitted near the center)
	- Happens in **younger** galaxies
- **Inactive**

## Active Galactic Nuclei
- **Quasar**
	- BH's that "eat" nearby stars
	- Found in young galaxies b/c there are still stars close enough to be **accreted** into BH
	- As matter is pulled it, matter and energy gets **ejected** in "jets"
	- Emits **UV** radiation
	- **Brighter** than Seyferts
	- **Far away** from MW
		- Tend to be found in **older** galaxies
- **Seyferts**
	- 10% of galaxies
	- **Spiral** galaxies
	- Younger than quasars

## Spectroscopy
- All atoms of the **same neutral element** has the **same number of electrons**
- With the same number of electrons, these atoms have the **same electron configuration**, giving them a **specific pattern** when they absorb/emit light
- **Spectroscopy** = Analysis of the patterns of light when atoms emit/absorb light
- No two elemental spectra are the same (fingerprints)
- **Studying Hydrogen**
	- **Hydrogen-Alpha HII Line**
	- ONLY EMISSION LINES

## Doppler Effect
- Red = Moving away (most galaxies are red shifted)
- Blue = Moving towards (Andromeda is blue shifted)
- Allows us to determine the relative motion of galaxies compared to us

## Cepheid Variables
- Distance to **nearby galaxies**
- **Cepheid variables** = Type of star regular cycles of brightness and luminosity (pulsates, varies in diameter and temperature)
- Brighter the cepheid = Longer cycle of brightness/dimness (solar cycle = 11 years)

## Hubble's Law
- Comparing the HII rest spectra to the actual HII spectra of the galaxy lets us calculate **red shift**
- ***GALAXIES FARTHER AWAY ARE MOVING AWAY FROM US FASTER***
- Accelerated expansion of universe
- Galaxies are expanding/retreating away at a speed that is **proportional** to their distance = *Farthest galaxies are moving away the fastest*
- Used to determine distances of galaxies **far away**

## Stellar Parallax
-  Measure distance to very close objects
![](Pasted%20image%2020230607182727.png)

## Measure mass of galaxies
- Based on orbital motion of stars
- More massive galaxies --> More gravitational pull --> **Stars orbit faster**
- Gravity is dependent on **mass and distance**

## Dark Matter
- Majority of mass in the universe is **invisible**
- Unable to be **detected**
- Determined there wasn't enough **observable mass** in a galaxy to explain fast rotational speed of stars
- **Fundamental particles** that have not been previously detected



# General Relativity
- Special Relativity only applied to observers moving in a straight line at a constant speed
	- Did not apply if gravity was present
- Einstein wondered what would happen if a window washer would fall
	- What would the window washer experience when **he was falling**
		- A person being in free-fall is the same as being in space (weightless)
		- Was able to connect gravity to special relativity with the theory of acceleration
- You are in a room w/ no windows and a bathroom scale
	- Stationary on Earth = Your actual weight
	- Room inside of rocket in space accelerating at the speed of gravity ($9.8m/s^2$) = Your actual weight
- *Is there a way to tell the difference between acceleration and gravity?*
	- Take a laser beam and point it at one side of the room to another on the accelerating spaceship
	- The height of the laser point on the other side of the room would be slightly lower
	- **Light beam would appear to cuve downward**
	- What if you did the same on Earth? *The acceleration in the spaceship should be no different than gravity on Earth*
	- **LIGHT MUST BEND IN THE PRESENCE OF GRAVITY**
	- Shortest path between two points on Earth is always curved
	- **In the presence of mass and energy, space is curved...Light must take a curved path in space as well**
- Newtonian physics at the time believed time and space were **fixed**
- Einstein = Gravity **emerges** from the interaction between space and matter
> *"Space-time tells matter how to move, Matter tells space-time how to curve."*

- Solves **Mercury's** orbit
	- Mercury had a **precession** orbit
- General Relativity would predict Mercury's precession
![](Pasted%20image%2020230605145021.png)

- Actual position of stars appear to be different than their predicted locations
- **As light passes near the Sun, it is bent b/c of the curvature of gravity**
![](Pasted%20image%2020230605145219.png)

- Speed of light in presence of gravity is **equal** to speed of light in empty space
	- Due to the curvature of space, the distance is longer.
	- **THEREFORE TIME ITSELF MUST PASS SLOWER**
- Time travels **slower** in presence of gravitational mass
	- Clocks on Earth are slower than clocks on ISS
- General Relativity fails at the singularity of a BH
- Relativity is incompatible with quantum mechanics --> Quantum gravity theory
