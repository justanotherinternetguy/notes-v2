# Graph Theory
- Vertex/nodes + Edge
	- Identify set of vertices + identify set of edges
- **Undirected graph** = an edge from `A` to `B` is the same as an edge from `B` to `A`
- **Directed graph** = an edge with a specified direction (one-way road)
- **Connected graph** = if there is a path from every vertex to every other vertex in the graph
- **Cycle** = path where the first and last vertex are the same (does not have to visit every vertex)
