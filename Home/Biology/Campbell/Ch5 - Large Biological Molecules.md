# 5.1 - MACROMOLECULES ARE POLYMERS, BUILT FROM MONOMERS
* **Polymer** = long molecule consisting of many similar or identical building blocks linked by **covalent** bonds
	* *Think = chain of train cabs*
* **Monomer** = repeating smaller units that build up a polymer

## SYNTHESIS AND BREAKDOWN
- **Enzymes** = Specialized macromolecules (usually **proteins**) that facilitate and **expedite** **chemical reactions**

- **Dehydration rxn (SYNTHESIS)** = Two molecules **bonded together** with the **loss of a water molecule**
	- Carbohydrate and protein polymers are synthesized with dehydration rxns
	- One reactant provides $-OH$, the other reactant provides $-H$ to make $H_2O$
- **Hydrolysis (BREAKDOWN)** = Bond is **broken** by **adding** $H_2O$
	- Digestion
