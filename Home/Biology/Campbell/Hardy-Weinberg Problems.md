# Hardy-Weinberg Problems
- In a population that is not evolving, **allele and genotype frequencies** will remain constant from**** generation to generation.
- Such a population is in H-W **equilibrium**
- Assume that reproduction is a process of **randomly selecting and combining alleles from a gene pool**

# $p^2 + 2pq + q^2 + 1$


## Problem 1
- Population of flowers
- Frequency of allele for RED (CR) is *p = 0.8*
- Frequence of allele for WHITE (CW) is *q = 0.2*

- This means that each egg/sperm has an 80% of containing a CR allele and has a 20% of containing a CW allele
- From this, we can caluluate the frequencies of the three possible genotypes
