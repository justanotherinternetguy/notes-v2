- Energy is a **scalar**
- Unit **joule (J)**
$$1 \;\text{joule} = 1\;\text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 / \text{s}^2$$


# Kinetic Energy
- Associated with **state of motion** of an object
- Nonnegative
$$K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
> A 3.0 kg duck flying past at 2 m/s as a KE of 6J

# Work
- Work $W$ is energy transferred to or from an object by means of a force acting on the object. Energy transferred **to the object = positive work**, Energy transferred **from the object = negative work**
- Weight will be represented as $mg$
