# Force
- **Unit** = The acceleration a force would give to the standard kilogram
- Suppose we put a body on a horizontal, frictionless surface and pull horizontally such that the body has an acceleration of **1 $\text{m/s}^2$**. Then, we can define our applied force as 1 **newton (N)**
- If we pulled with a force magnitude of 2N, the acceleration would be 2 $\text{m/s}^2$
- **If the standard body of 1 kg has an acceleration of magnitude $a$, then the force (newtons) would equal $a$**

# Newton's First Law (Law of Inertial)
- If $\vec{F}_\text{net} = 0$, the body's velocity cannot change

# Inertial Reference Frames
- An inertial frame is a reference frame where Newton's laws hold true
- We can assume the ground is an inertial frame **provided we ignore the Earth's astronomical movement**

# Mass
- Acceleration is **inversely related** to mass
- We push on the standard body (1 kg) with 1N of force
	- Accel. of 1 $\text{m/s}^2$
- Push on body X with the same force
	- Accel. of $0.25 \text{m/s}^2$

$$\frac{m_x}{m_0} = \frac{a_0}{a_x}$$

$$m_x = m_0 \frac{a_0}{a_x} = (1.0\;\text{kg})\frac{1.0\;\text{m/s}^2}{0.25\;\text{m/s}^2} = 4.0\;\text{kg}$$
- In this context, **the mass of a body is the characteristic that relates a force on the body to he resulting acceleration**


# Newton's Second Law
$$\vec{F}_{\text{net}} = m\vec{a}$$
- Similarly,
$$F_{\text{net, x}} = ma_x$$
$$F_{\text{net, y}} = ma_y$$
$$F_{\text{net, z}} = ma_z$$
- Accel. component along a given axis is caused **only by** the sum of the force components on the **same axis**
