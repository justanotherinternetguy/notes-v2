# 1D Kinematics (Chapter 2)
- Velocity - curve
	- Area under curve
	- $\Delta x = v_0 \Delta t$
	- Continue to slice $\Delta t$ smaller and smaller (Riemann Sum)
	- Make number of slices infinintely large - Definition of integration
	- $$\Delta x = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} v(t) dt$$
	- Displacement can also be negative/subtracted
		- Subtract area under $x=0$

$$\Delta x = v_0 t + \frac{1}{2} at^2$$
$$v = v_0 + at$$
