# 2-1: Position, Displacement, and Average Velocity

## Key Equations
### Displacement (vector)
- aka $x - x_0$
$$\Delta x = x_2 - x_1$$

### Average Velocity (vector) (m/s)
$$v_{avg} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{x_2 - x_1}{t_2 - t_1}$$
- **Slope** of straight line on graph of $x$ vs. $t$
- Magnitude is the magnitude of line's slope
- Will always have the same sign as **displacement** b/c $\Delta t > 0$

### Average Speed
$$S_{avg} = \frac{\text{total distance}}{\Delta t}$$
- No sign (does not include direction)

# Instantaneous velocity and speed
## Key Equations

### Velocity
$$v = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{dx}{dt}$$

# Acceleration
## Key Equations

### Average Acceleration
$$a_{avg} = \frac{v_2 - v_1}{t_2 - t_1} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$$

### Acceleration
$$a = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}$$



# Equations for constant acceleration

$$(\star)\; v = v_0 + at$$
$$(\star) \; x - x_0 = v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2$$
$$v^2 = v^2_0 + 2a(x - x_0)$$
$$x - x_0 = \frac{1}{2}(v_0 + v_t)$$
$$x - x_0 = vt - \frac{1}{2}at^2$$

# Free-Fall acceleration
$$g = 9.8 m/s^2$$
- Directions of motions are now along a vertical $y$ axis
	- Positive $y$ is **upward**
- Free-fall acceleration is **negative**
	- Therefore, it has the value $-g$ in equations


# Graphical Integration
- Graph of $a$ vs. $t$
	- Integrate on graph to find $v_t$
- B/c $a = dv/dt$...
$$v_1 - v_0 = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} a \; dt$$
- Aka *area between acceleration curve and time axis, from $t_0$ to $t_1$*

- Similarly, 
$$x_1 - x_0 = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} v \; dt$$
- Aka *area between velocity curve and time axis, from $t_0$ to $t_1$*
