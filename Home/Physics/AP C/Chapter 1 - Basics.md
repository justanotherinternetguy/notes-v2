- **Book** = *Fundamentals of Physics Extended*
- Know precalc, basic derivatives of integrals

- Science of experiments

# Measurements (Ch 1)
- What do we have to measure?
	- Fundamental quantity of physics
		- Space (length) (meters)
			- $\gt 10^6$ Relativity and Cosmology
			- $10^3 \to 10^{-3}$ Classical mechanics
			- $10^{-6} \to 10^{-12}$ Quantum mechanics
			- What's inside a nucleus?
				- Elementary particles, strong/weak force, quantum mech
		- Time
	- Mass (kilogram)
		- How much "stuff" is in an object?
		- $12 \;\text{amu} = {}^{12}_6C$ = 1 proton = 1 neutron
		- Carbon-12 is very stable
		- **Binding energy** = Smallest amount of energy to remove a particle from a system of particles (nucleus)

- Derived units
	- Made up of different fundamental units
	- Velocity = length/time (m/sec)
	- Accel = velo/time = length/time^2


- Spectrum of atom
	- When an atom absorbs energy, electrons will jump to higher rings of energy
	- Atoms can only absorb certain waves
		- Frequency, Wavelength, Amplitude
		- Period = inverse of frequency (distance between one crest to another)


# Motion in 1D (Ch 2)
- **Motion**
	- Occurs in 1 dimension (along a straight line)
	- Kinematics = study of motion
	- Dynamics = WHY does motion change
	- **Particle** = it is a point, no size
	- **Object** = no spin or rotation
- **Location/Position** = $x$
	- $x$ is a **real number** that indicates position on a number line
- **Average Velocity** = $$V_\text{avg} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{x_2 - x_1}{t_2 - t_1}$$
	- $V > 0$ = Movement to right
	- $V < 0$ = Movement to left
	- If you move 10 units right and then 10 units left, the average velocity is ZERO

- **Speed** = $$S_\text{avg} = \frac{\text{total distance}}{\Delta t}$$
	- **Distance IS NOT displacement!!**
	- Displacement can be 0 but distance can be 20
