- Brian = to go Brazil to escape racism, contrast from Irene's alleged loyalty to being black
- "Half succeeded" = feels less paranoid
- "look for trouble and finding it in good measure"
- "Merely that" = downplaying tone, does not sueccess
- "not quite"
- "two allegiances"
	- What is race to irene? something that unites?
	- united b/c they are all oppressed
	- if you are loyal to your race, aren't you being controlled by an oppressive force?
- power?? irene CAN tell john, but that will go against her own values
- "for the first time..."
	- suffering = being woman + being a person
	- without having to suffer racially as well
- not john finding that clare is black, but instead finding that clare (as white) as been spending time in a black community
	
- control
	- instinctively wants clare to be safe, does make clare safe
	- loyalty to racial beliefs - power

- she has control over her own selfish desires to exopse clare
	- last paragraph
	- selfish desire BUT she does not want to be involved in clare's exposing, she prevents herself in exposing clare (integrity to her values)
